#   1. #RGB with "R", "G" and "B" hexadecimal numbers (0-9, A-F or
#      a-f).
#   2. #RRGGBB with each occurence of "R", "G" and "B" are hexadecimal
#      numbers (0-9, A-F or a-f).
#   3. rgba(R, G, B, A) where "R", "G" and "B" are between 0 and 255
#      and A is a floating point number between 0 and 1 representing
#      the alpha channel (transparency).
